# Jon Roobottom’s personal website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roobottom/roobottom-2017.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/roobottom/roobottom-2017)

This is the source code for my personal website. It’s a static-html website that’s generated by [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Most of what my `gulpfile.js` does is string together third-party plugins, but it does use some custom plugins that I built specifically (see `/modules_backend`).

I drew heavily on the ideas of Sean Farrell’s [source code](https://github.com/rioki/www.rioki.org) for his own personal site.

## API

The API consists of the following CLI commands:

* `gulp`: to build the site, watch for changes, and set-up a local test server.
* `gulp images`: to process all the images used by the site into web-ready files.
* `gulp build`: to build the static site. Outputs to the `./docs` folder.

## Pattern Library API

Each pattern should have a corresponding `.md` file that contains the pattern description and examples. For example, the folder for the `m_prose` pattern looks like this:

```
+-- m_prose
|  +-- m_prose.html
|  +-- m_prose.less
|  +-- m_prose.md
```

Where:

* `m_prose.html` is the pattern definition file
* `m_prose.less` is the pattern style file
* `m_prose.md` is the pattern description file

### Dummy data for a pattern

There is an API that enables passing-in of dummy data to the patterns via the pattern description file. This is done via `YMAL` front-matter in the description file.
